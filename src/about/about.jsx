      <p>Block Bonanza is a grid based game where you move your square from space to space absorbing smaller cubes before they can become bigger than you. As the game progresses the faster and harder the game gets. Your goal is to see how long you can last, represented by how many points you can get per game. If a cube becomes too big for you to absorb, then you can no longer move to that space. The game ends when can no longer move. Want a competitive experience? Try to get a higher highscore than your friends and/or the top 10 high scores! See if you can become number one!</p>
