# Midterm
1. <link> is used to link external resources to the HTML document (i.e. CSS stylesheets) and is self-closing and usually placed in the <head> section.
2. <div> is a block-level container that is used to group HTML elements together.
3. #title targets an element with the specific id title, while .grid targets elements witht the class grid.
4. Padding is the space between the content and the border of an element, while margin is the space outside the border, between the element and neighboring elements.
5. With a flexbox, images inside a flex container can be arranged in a row or column, and can be aligned and justified in various ways.
- .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row; /* or alignment */
    justify-content: center; /* alignment */
    align-items: center; /* alignment */
  }
6. padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px
- Top padding: 10px
- Right padding: 20px
- Bottom padding: 15px
- Left padding: 5px
7. const add = (a, b) => a + b -- declares a function add that takes two parameters and returns their sum.
8. Map with an array:
- const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
- const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
- console.log(doubled);
- Output: [2, 4, 6]
9. Using getElementByID and addEventListener:
- document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Button clicked');
- });
- When the button is clicked, it logs "Button clicked" to the console.
10. Line of JavaScript using a # selector:
- document.querySelector('#elementId').style.color = 'blue';
- This selects the element with the id elementId and changes its text color to blue.
